# Agent Environment Simulation

This project is a simulation that demonstrates an agent moving within a 2D environment, built using **Pygame**. The agent can be controlled using keyboard inputs and moves dynamically within the environment.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Agent Movement**: Use arrow keys to move the agent in all directions.
- **Speed Adjustment**: The agent's speed increases slightly with every movement.
- **Screen Wrapping**: The agent wraps around the screen boundaries for seamless movement.
- **Real-Time Display**: Displays the agent's current position and speed.

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- **`run.py`**: The main file that initializes the simulation, sets up the environment, and handles user input.
- **`agent.py`**: Defines the `Agent` class, which represents the agent in the simulation. Handles movement logic and speed adjustments.
- **`enviroment.py`**: Defines the `Enviroment` class, which manages the environment's dimensions and constraints.

---
1.##Run the main file:
python run.py

2.##Use the arrow keys to move the agent:
 - Up Arrow: Move up
 - Down Arrow: Move down
 - Left Arrow: Move left
 - Right Arrow: Move right

 - ##**📊 Outputs
-Position: The current (x, y) coordinates of the agent are displayed on the screen.
-Speed: The agent's speed is dynamically updated and shown in real-time.
